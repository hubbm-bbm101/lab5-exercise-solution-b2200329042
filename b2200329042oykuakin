#1. Write a program that asks for a number N as a user input, and calculates the sum of odd numbers, and the average of even numbers starting from 1 up to and including N.
n = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
sum1 = 0
sum2 = 0
a = 0
for i in range (0,n+1):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        sum1 += i
    elif i % 2 == 0:
        a += 1
        sum2 += i
        sum2 = sum2/a
print("Odd number sum ", sum1)
print("Even number sum: ", sum2)

#3. Guessing game! Pick a number randomly. While user does not guess the number correctly give an instruction about the number and take another guess from user.
Instruction:
import random
guessesTaken = 0
number = random.randint(1, 20)
print("I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.")
while guessesTaken < 6:
    print("Your guess?")
    guess=input()
    guess=int(guess)
    
guessesTaken = guessesTaken + 1
if guess < number:
    print('Your guess is too low.')
if guess > number:
    print('Your guess is too high.')
if guess == number:
    break
if guess == number:
    guessesTaken = str(guessesTaken)
    print('Well Done !,'+ guessesTaken + ' guesses!')
if guess != number:
          number = str(number)
          print('Nope'+ number)
